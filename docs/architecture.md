# Architecture

`@alyldas/uniauth-core` is split into four layers.

## Domain

Domain exports stable types for users, identities, credentials, verifications, sessions, provider
assertions, audit events, branded IDs, and utility constructors.

The central invariant is that `User` and `AuthIdentity` are different entities. A user can have many
identities, and email/phone are optional identity attributes.

## Application

`DefaultAuthService` owns use-case orchestration:

- `signIn`
- `startOtpChallenge`
- `finishOtpChallenge`
- `finishOtpSignIn`
- `startEmailMagicLinkSignIn`
- `finishEmailMagicLinkSignIn`
- `signInWithPassword`
- `setPassword`
- `changePassword`
- `startEmailPasswordRecovery`
- `finishEmailPasswordRecovery`
- `link`
- `unlink`
- `mergeAccounts`
- `createSession`
- `revokeSession`
- `revokeUserSessions`
- `resolveSession`
- `resolveSessionContext`
- `getCurrentAccountSecuritySnapshot`
- `getCurrentAccountInspectionSnapshot`
- `getCurrentAccountClosureExportSnapshot`
- `getCurrentAccountAuditEventPage`
- `startCurrentAccountOtpReAuth`
- `resendCurrentAccountOtpReAuth`
- `cancelCurrentAccountOtpReAuth`
- `finishCurrentAccountOtpReAuth`
- `getCurrentAccountReAuthStatus`
- `assertCurrentAccountReAuth`
- `linkCurrentIdentityByToken`
- `revokeCurrentSessionByToken`
- `revokeOwnedSessionByToken`
- `revokeOtherSessionsByToken`
- `unlinkCurrentIdentityByToken`
- `updateCurrentAccountProfileByToken`
- `startCurrentAccountContactChange`
- `resendCurrentAccountContactChange`
- `cancelCurrentAccountContactChange`
- `finishCurrentAccountContactChange`
- `confirmCurrentAccountPasswordByToken`
- `setCurrentAccountPasswordByToken`
- `changeCurrentAccountPasswordByToken`
- `closeCurrentAccountByToken`
- `touchSession`
- `getUser`
- `getUserCredentials`
- `getUserSessions`
- `getAuditEvents`
- `getAccountSecuritySnapshot`
- `getAccountInspectionSnapshot`
- `createVerification`
- `getVerification`
- `toAuditEventView`
- `toAccountSecuritySnapshot`
- `toVerificationStatusView`
- `consumeVerification`

It delegates authorization decisions to `AuthPolicy` and storage/provider/sender work to ports.

The flat method names remain available for compatibility. New route code should prefer the
canonical grouped surface, which is organized by caller trust boundary:

- `auth.public`: unauthenticated sign-in, OTP, magic-link, and password-recovery flows.
- `auth.account`: current-account self-service by `sessionToken`, including profile, contact,
  password, recent-auth, own sessions, own identities, snapshots, audit page, and account closure.
- `auth.admin`: trusted backend and operator flows by `userId`, including user reads, user sessions,
  account merge/link/unlink, raw session operations, raw verification operations, and audit reads.

Public sign-in methods return `PublicAuthResult`, whose user, identity, and session fields are safe
views. Raw `Session.tokenHash`, `Credential.passwordHash`, and `Verification.secretHash` stay out of
the canonical public facade.

```ts
await auth.public.password.signIn({ email, password })
await auth.account.profile.update({ sessionToken, displayName })
await auth.admin.users.get(userId)
```

## Merge and Trust Boundary

`mergeAccounts(...)` is intentionally a privileged account mutation. It requires `sourceSessionToken`
so the active source account is proven before state moves to the target account. Trusted backend and
admin routes may still add stronger application-level approvals around that proof, but they should
not merge by raw `sourceUserId` alone.

## Ports

Core defines repository ports, credential ports, provider registry, sender ports, rate-limit port,
password hashing port, audit log port, verification secret hashing extension point, and
`UnitOfWork`.

The audit log port is now read-capable as well as write-capable. Core still owns local security
event creation, while trusted backend tooling can read the resulting `AuditEvent` timeline through
the public service layer without reaching into adapter internals.

Session resolution remains transport-agnostic. Core can now collapse `sessionToken -> session + user`
into one trusted read-side helper, while cookie parsing, bearer extraction, and request decoration
stay application-owned.

Current-account security routes can also stay on trusted token-based helpers without reassembling
that flow on every backend. Core can now resolve a trusted local `sessionToken`, load the current
account-security aggregate, or revoke the current/other local sessions through one narrow helper
layer while cookie clearing, header parsing, and outward payload shaping remain application-owned.
That same trusted boundary now also covers current-account inspection snapshots and current-account
audit page reads, so self-service security routes do not have to mix admin inspection helpers with
manual session ownership resolution. Selected-device revoke, sign-in-method link or unlink, and
local password setup or change can now stay on that same token-based boundary instead of bouncing
back to raw `userId` mutation calls after middleware resolution. Recent-auth bootstrapping can now
stay on the same trusted boundary too: applications can start, resend, finish, or cancel
current-account OTP re-auth by owned identity and `sessionToken`, or confirm the current password
from `sessionToken`, then persist the resulting server-issued marker object in app-owned session
state. That marker carries `currentSessionId`, `userId`, `markerId`, and `reAuthenticatedAt`, and
token-based current-account mutations reject bare timestamps, unknown marker ids, or markers issued
for another current session. The same layer can now also answer or enforce whether recent auth is
currently required for a specific sensitive current-account action before application-owned side
effects continue, without dropping back to generic verification ownership checks in route code.
Account closure follows the same shape:
the current session token identifies the actor, core disables the current user, revokes active
local sessions, and leaves cookie clearing, legal retention, and downstream data deletion to the
application. Pre-closure export snapshots also stay on that boundary: core returns safe local auth
views and a bounded audit window, while file generation, legal export policy, billing state, and
application-profile data remain outside the package. Current-account profile updates stay on the
same boundary for local auth display-name changes. Verified email or phone changes can also stay on
that boundary through a dedicated contact-change OTP lifecycle that updates only the local `User`
contact field after proof of the new target. Sign-in identities, password credential subjects,
OAuth provider profiles, avatars, media storage, notification preferences, and product profile
records remain application-owned or identity-flow-owned.

OTP challenges use `EmailSender` for email delivery and `SmsSender` for phone delivery. Core
creates and hashes the verification secret, tracks the verification lifecycle, and maps successful
sign-in challenges to local provider identities. The application owns the real SMTP, transactional
email, SMS gateway, or queue adapter.

OTP sign-in uses the unified `startOtpChallenge` and `finishOtpSignIn` API for both email and phone.
The built-in generator stays numeric, with configurable length from 4 to 8 digits, and applications
can provide a custom generator for app-owned formats. The built-in email OTP subject is configurable
without replacing the whole `EmailSender`.

Verification records keep core-owned routing fields such as `provider` and `channel` separate from
app-owned `metadata`. Adapters should persist those fields explicitly instead of inferring core flow
state from arbitrary metadata.

Email magic links use the same verification lifecycle and the existing `EmailSender` port. The
application provides `createLink` per start request, so routes, domains, redirect handling, cookies,
and query parameter conventions remain outside core.

Password credentials use `CredentialRepo` for stored password hashes, `PasswordHasher` for
hash/verify work, and an optional `PasswordPolicy` port for new password material. Core does not
bundle a password hashing runtime or strength rules; production applications pass adapters backed by
their chosen algorithm, parameters, secret-loading policy, and breached-password or strength checks.
Password identity records use the local `password` provider so unlink and last-sign-in-method policy
remains shared with other identities.

Verification hashing is delegated to `SecretHasher`. The default hasher uses salted `scrypt` so
short OTP values are not stored as fast hashes. Production deployments that need app-owned key
material can pass a custom hasher, for example `createHmacSecretHasher` with an application-owned
pepper loaded during bootstrap.

Rate limiting is delegated to `RateLimiter`. Core only defines stable actions and calls the port
before security-sensitive attempts such as provider sign-in, OTP start/finish, magic-link
start/finish, password sign-in, and password recovery. Applications own the real Redis, database,
edge runtime, or hosted rate-limit adapter and decide exact bucket sizes, key hashing, and retry
headers. Production runtime construction fails fast without a limiter by default; low-level tests or
controlled internal runtimes can set `requireRateLimiter: false` to opt out explicitly. Production
bootstraps can also set `requirePasswordPolicy: true` to fail fast when password flows are enabled
without an application password policy. Verification resend cooldown defaults to 60 seconds in
production runtime configuration and can be set to `0` only by explicit runtime configuration.

The built-in `normalizeEmail`, `normalizePhone`, and `normalizeTarget` helpers are compatibility
utilities, not a full production canonicalization policy. If an application needs strict email
validation or E.164 phone handling, it should pass one shared `normalizer` boundary across provider
assertions, OTP, magic link, password, and repository lookup paths instead of normalizing each flow
independently. See [Normalization boundary](normalization.md).

Provider integrations use the same `AuthProvider` boundary. External adapter packages or
application code validate provider-specific input, map it into `ProviderIdentityAssertion`, and
leave SDK setup, authorization URL creation, callback routes, state and nonce validation, redirect
URI policy, provider secrets, HTTP clients, token storage, bot setup, frontend bridge code, cookies,
and persistence outside core. Applications can attach normalized trust context to assertions so
`AuthPolicy` can make auto-link, explicit-link, and merge decisions without receiving raw SDK
objects.

Delivery happens after the verification record has been created inside `UnitOfWork`. If a sender
fails, the pending verification stays in storage until normal expiry or adapter cleanup; core does
not roll back storage after an external delivery side effect fails.

Queue-backed delivery should wrap `EmailSender` or `SmsSender`, not replace them with a new core
dispatcher contract. Core does not track delivery attempts, retries, dead-letter state, or
provider-specific webhooks. Those remain application-owned or optional-adapter-owned delivery
infrastructure concerns.

`UnitOfWork` is intentionally part of v0.1 so storage adapters can provide real transaction
boundaries for link, unlink, merge, session, and verification flows.

## Testing Adapter

`@alyldas/uniauth-core/testing` provides an in-memory implementation for tests, demos, and examples. It
includes in-memory email and SMS senders, a rate limiter, and a low-cost `scrypt` password hasher so
local auth flows can be exercised without SMTP, SMS, Redis, or password-hashing runtime setup. It is
not a production persistence adapter. The public testing entry point stays stable while internal
modules keep store/repository state, sender fakes, and support utilities separate so persistence
work does not pull the testing kit back into one monolith.

## Adapter Requirements

Storage adapters should:

- enforce unique active provider identities by `(provider, providerUserId)`;
- keep user, identity, session, verification, and audit records separate;
- keep password credentials separate from identities and store only password hashes;
- store only session token hashes, not bearer session tokens;
- apply `UnitOfWork` to sensitive multi-write flows;
- keep merge conflict detection aligned with unique credential and identity ownership constraints;
- store only hashed verification secrets;
- avoid email/phone ownership inference outside the policy-controlled flow.

Provider adapters should expose `finish()` and return a `ProviderIdentityAssertion`. Core does not
own provider SDK setup, redirect routes, raw provider payload storage, or application secrets.
Provider-specific signature validation can live in a small reference adapter when it does not force
SDK, framework, or storage dependencies into the core package.
When provider trust matters, adapters should emit a small `trust` object with stable string
signals instead of leaking provider SDK payloads into core policy hooks.

## Contracts vs Ports

The project has two related boundaries:

- `@alyldas/uniauth-core/contracts` exports stable, implementation-neutral contracts that are meant for
  package-level compatibility and shared type/runtime understanding.
- Runtime `ports` are integration seams that are injected at application bootstrap through adapters or
  concrete helper implementations such as stores, senders, providers, rate limiters, and hashers.

In practice: import contracts from `@alyldas/uniauth-core/contracts` when you need stable semantics across
packages, and keep `ports` as app-owned wiring points. This prevents implementation details from
leaking across package boundaries while preserving an explicit runtime ownership model.

## Provider Adapter Layout

Provider adapters live outside core. The root entry point stays focused on core service APIs;
provider-specific code imports an external adapter package or application-owned module.

Each provider family should keep the same rough split when it reduces real complexity:

- a public package or module entrypoint;
- provider IDs and small constants;
- payload extraction from `FinishInput`;
- provider-specific validation and freshness checks;
- assertion mapping into `ProviderIdentityAssertion`;
- provider factory functions that return `AuthProvider`.

Adapter code should stay SDK-free unless the adapter is moved out of core into a dedicated package.
Framework handlers, redirects, callbacks, cookies, secret loading, and provider SDK clients remain
application-owned.

## Repository Shape

The project starts as a single package so the core domain contracts can stabilize before adapters
become separate packages.

Future provider, persistence, and HTTP integrations should stay outside the core package unless they
are small reference contracts. If the ecosystem grows into multiple maintained adapters, the project
can move to a monorepo with packages for storage, providers, and framework-specific HTTP wiring.

## Current Public Entry Points

The current package already models the intended long-term split through explicit public entry points:

- `@alyldas/uniauth-core`:
  core domain types, service facade, policies, errors, read-side helpers, and local auth flows.
- `@alyldas/uniauth-core/contracts`:
  implementation-free contracts for repositories, runtime primitives, senders, rate limits, and
  provider integration boundaries.
- `@alyldas/uniauth-core/testing`:
  in-memory store, senders, providers, and test-only support utilities.

This is a modular monolith boundary, not a monorepo yet. New capabilities should prefer an explicit
subpath before introducing another root export or another package.

## Extraction Criteria

Move a subpath into a separate npm package only when most of these are true:

1. The public API is already consumed through an explicit subpath rather than a root export.
2. The module can depend only on stable root/core types and `@alyldas/uniauth-core/contracts`, not on
   internal source paths.
3. The module has runtime dependencies, operational assumptions, or release cadence that can change
   independently from core.
4. The module has its own focused tests, smoke coverage, and docs/examples without hidden coupling
   to unrelated package internals.
5. The extraction reduces real package ownership pressure, such as provider SDK churn, database
   driver cadence, or framework-specific integration surface.
6. The new boundary is understandable enough that a consumer can choose it intentionally.

If those criteria are not met, keep the code in the current package and harden the subpath
boundary instead of splitting prematurely.

## Migration Expectations

- Do not import from internal `src/**` paths in application code, tests outside this repository, or
  downstream packages.
- Prefer the public subpath that matches the module family you need; do not assume that a root
  compatibility re-export is the permanent home of that API.
- When a future extraction happens, the same release should update the docs, examples, changelog,
  and migration notes so consumers can move from the old subpath cleanly.
- Before `1.0.0`, package extraction can still happen in a minor release, but only after the
  boundary has been explicit and documented first.
