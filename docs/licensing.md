# Licensing and Attribution

## Public License

`@alyldas/uniauth-core` is source-available under the PolyForm Strict License 1.0.0. Commercial use,
redistribution, making changes, or creating new works based on the software require a separate paid
license, subscription, private contract, or other written permission.

See [LICENSE](../LICENSE), [NOTICE](../NOTICE), and [COMMERCIAL.md](../COMMERCIAL.md).

## Attribution

`@alyldas/uniauth-core` ships a stable attribution object and a plain-text helper for About, Legal,
Notices, or acknowledgements screens:

```ts
import { UNIAUTH_ATTRIBUTION, getUniAuthAttributionNotice } from '@alyldas/uniauth-core'

const metadata = UNIAUTH_ATTRIBUTION
const notice = getUniAuthAttributionNotice({ productName: 'Example App' })
```

The helper is pure. It does not send telemetry, read environment variables, touch storage, or expose
anything automatically.
