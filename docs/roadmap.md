  inspection flows across in-memory and Postgres-backed service setups.

Tracking issues: #190, #191, #192.

### v0.31 - Audit Page Metadata and Trusted Support Pagination

- Add page-oriented `getAuditEventPage(...)` to the public read-side service surface so trusted

Tracking issues: #199, #200, #201.

### v0.32 - Verification Resend Windows and Abuse-Control Helpers

- Add public `getVerificationResendWindow(...)` so OTP and magic-link backends can read
  cooldown, expiry, and resend-eligibility state without reaching into repositories.
- Add public rate-limit helper surface for stable key composition and typed extraction of neutral
  `rate_limited` metadata from `UniAuthError`.
- Add focused resend-window and rate-limit parity coverage across in-memory and Postgres-backed
  service setups.

  Postgres-backed service setups.
- Add trusted backend recipes for cancellation endpoints next to the existing resend and cooldown
  flows.

Tracking issues: #221, #222, #223, #224.

### v0.35 - Package Boundary Hardening

- Keep `v0.35` inside one package; this is boundary hardening, not a monorepo migration.
- Introduce a narrow public contracts boundary that future storage, provider, bridge, and testing
  packages can depend on without importing implementation modules.
- Move pure domain rules out of application support so package extraction does not drag service
  orchestration internals across layers.
- Separate runtime composition from application use cases and replace derived repository patches
  with explicit patch contracts where the persistence boundary needs them.
- Add provider-specific subpath exports and enforce source import boundaries so the public package
  shape matches the intended long-term split.
- Document extraction criteria and migration expectations before any physical multi-package move, so
  future package extraction happens only after the subpath boundary is already explicit.

Tracking issues: #225, #226, #227, #228, #229, #230, #231.

### v0.36 - Current-Account Security Helpers

- Added `getCurrentAccountSecuritySnapshot({ sessionToken, touch?, now? })` for self-service
  account-security routes that already trust a local session token.
- Added token-based self-service session revoke helpers for current-session logout and
  sign-out-other-devices flows without rebuilding session + user ownership checks in every backend.
- Added parity coverage for the current-account helper layer across in-memory and Postgres-backed
  service setups, including stale-session neutrality and current-session markers.
- Updated account-security and session-transport recipes so current-account routes use the aggregate
  helper layer instead of manual multi-call composition.

Tracking issues: #244, #245, #246, #247.

### v0.37 - Current-Account Inspection Helpers

- Added `getCurrentAccountInspectionSnapshot({ sessionToken, touch?, now?, audit? })` so self-service
  security routes can load current-account snapshot state and a bounded audit window through one
  trusted local-session helper.
- Added `getCurrentAccountAuditEventPage({ sessionToken, touch?, now?, ...filters })` so current
  account security timelines can paginate through the same neutral trusted-session boundary without
  re-resolving ownership in each route.
- Added parity coverage for current-account aggregate inspection and page helpers across in-memory and
  Postgres-backed service setups, including stale-session neutrality and current-session markers.
- Updated account-security, session-transport, backend, and architecture docs so self-service
  security routes use the current-account inspection layer instead of mixing admin inspection with
  manual session resolution.

Tracking issues: #251, #252, #253, #254.

### v0.38 - Current-Account Action Helpers

- Added token-based current-account write-side helpers for selected-session revoke, sign-in-method
  unlink, and local password setup or change after transport resolution.
- Added parity and neutrality coverage for those helpers across in-memory and Postgres-backed
  service setups, including disabled-account session-token paths.
- Updated account-security, backend, session-transport, and README recipes so self-service routes
  stay on the trusted `sessionToken` boundary instead of bouncing back to raw `userId` mutations.

Tracking issues: #258, #259, #260, #261.

### v0.39 - Current-Account Re-Auth Helpers

- Added trusted current-account OTP re-auth helpers so self-service security routes can bootstrap
  recent-auth challenges from a local `sessionToken` boundary instead of rebuilding owned-target
  verification flows in application code.
- Added a current-account password re-auth confirmation helper that proves the current password on
  the trusted session boundary without mutating local credentials or widening neutral failure
  shapes.
- Added parity and neutrality coverage for current-account re-auth helpers across in-memory and
  Postgres-backed service setups, including stale-session, disabled-account, and owned-target edge
  cases.
- Added canonical backend and account-security recipes for app-owned recent-auth persistence, OTP
  re-auth challenge routes, and sensitive current-account actions that consume `reAuthenticatedAt`.

Tracking issues: #265, #266, #267, #268.

### v0.40 - Current-Account Recent-Auth Guards

- Added a trusted current-account recent-auth status helper so self-service routes can ask whether
  a specific sensitive action currently requires recent auth without duplicating policy checks or
  owned-session resolution in application code.
- Added a trusted current-account recent-auth assertion helper so backend routes can enforce the
  same `ReAuthRequired` policy boundary and audit trail before app-owned side effects continue.
- Added parity and neutrality coverage for the recent-auth helper layer across in-memory and
  Postgres-backed service setups, including stale-session, disabled-account, and token-based
  password-action paths.
- Added canonical docs for current-account recent-auth status reads and guard assertions while
  keeping `reAuthenticatedAt` persistence app-owned.

Tracking issues: #273, #274, #275, #276.

### v0.41 - Current-Account Identity Linking

- Added a trusted `linkCurrentIdentityByToken(...)` helper so self-service account-management
  routes can keep identity linking on the same `sessionToken` boundary as current-account
  inspection, session revoke, password actions, and recent-auth helpers.
- Added provider-finish parity for that helper so OAuth/OIDC, messenger, and other adapter-backed
  identity linking can stay on the trusted current-account boundary instead of dropping back to raw
  `userId` orchestration.
- Added focused in-memory and Postgres parity coverage for same-user relinks, exact already-linked
  conflicts, policy-denied paths, and stale or disabled current-account neutrality.
- Added canonical account-security, backend, architecture, and local-auth docs for current-account
  re-auth plus self-service identity linking route recipes.

Tracking issues: #280, #281, #282, #283.

### v0.42 - Current-Account OTP Re-Auth Challenge Management

- Kept current-account recent-auth flows on the same trusted `sessionToken` boundary after the
  challenge has started, so self-service routes no longer have to fall back to generic verification
  ownership orchestration for resend or cancellation.
- Added focused in-memory and Postgres parity coverage for resend and cancellation, including
  stale-session, foreign-verification, phone-target, and unexpected adapter-failure paths.
- Added canonical account-security, local-auth, architecture, and README route recipes for trusted
  current-account OTP re-auth management.

Tracking issues: #287, #288, #289, #290.

### v0.43 - Current-Account Account Closure

- Added a trusted `closeCurrentAccountByToken(...)` helper so self-service account closure routes can
  stay on the same `sessionToken` boundary as current-account inspection, session revoke, identity
  linking, password actions, and recent-auth helpers.
- Disabled the current user and revoked active local sessions inside the existing transaction
  boundary while leaving cookies, legal retention, billing cancellation, and downstream data
  deletion application-owned.
- Added focused in-memory and Postgres parity coverage for successful closure, recent-auth
  enforcement, revoked or expired sessions, disabled current-account neutrality, session revocation,
  and closure audit metadata.
- Added canonical account-security, backend, architecture, and README route recipes for trusted
  current-account account closure.

Tracking issues: #294, #295, #296, #297.

### v0.44 - Current-Account Closure Export

- Added a trusted `getCurrentAccountClosureExportSnapshot(...)` helper so self-service account
  closure flows can offer a safe pre-closure auth snapshot without reading storage internals.
- Kept the helper on the existing `sessionToken` boundary and reused safe account, credential,
  session, identity, and audit views without provider tokens, password hashes, session token hashes,
  verification hashes, or raw metadata.
- Added parity and secret-boundary coverage across in-memory and Postgres-backed service setups,
  including stale disabled-account neutrality.
- Added account-security and backend route recipes that keep file format, legal export policy,
  billing state, profile data, and downstream application records application-owned.

Tracking issues: #301, #302, #303, #304.

### v0.45 - Current-Account Profile Update

- Added a trusted `updateCurrentAccountProfileByToken(...)` helper so self-service profile routes can
  update local auth profile fields on the same `sessionToken` boundary as the rest of the
  current-account helper layer.
- Kept the helper scoped to local user profile fields such as display name, while email, phone,
  identities, credentials, avatars, media storage, and product profile tables remain application or
  identity-flow owned.
- Added parity and neutrality coverage across in-memory and Postgres-backed service setups, including
  stale-session, revoked-session, expired-session, and disabled-account paths.
- Added account-security and backend route recipes for safe current-account profile update routes.

Tracking issues: #308, #309, #310, #311.

### v0.46 - Current-Account Verified Contact Change

- Added trusted current-account verified contact change helpers for local `User.email` and
  `User.phone` updates after OTP proof of the new target.
- Kept start, resend, cancel, and finish routes on the existing `sessionToken` boundary with
  optional recent-auth policy enforcement through `AuthPolicyAction.UpdateContact`.
- Left sign-in identities, password credential subjects, provider profiles, notification
  preferences, and product profile tables outside the contact-change helper boundary.
- Added focused in-memory and Postgres parity coverage for re-auth enforcement, resend replacement,
  cancellation, foreign-verification neutrality, safe field updates, and contact-change audit
  metadata.
- Added account-security and backend route recipes plus runnable examples for self-service verified
  contact changes.
  Tracking issues: none.

## Next Release

### 1.0 - API Stabilization and Boundary Cleanup

- Completed all v0.46 API surfaces are considered released; next focus is first stable pre-1.0
  boundary cleanup before `1.0.0`.
- `mergeAccounts(...)` now requires a `sourceSessionToken` proof for active source accounts and
  should still remain behind trusted backend/admin approval when product policy needs stronger
  source-account confirmation.
- Provider adapter exports were removed from core; provider-specific consumers should use external
  adapter packages or application-owned provider modules.
- Add a contracts-vs-ports alignment section for package and application authors so contracts stay
  implementation-neutral while ports stay runtime-owned by app bootstrap.
- Update provider/token, support, and architecture docs so migration notes, admin boundaries, and
  package split criteria are explicit before moving further API contracts into separate packages.

Tracking issues: planned.

## Versioning

- `0.x`: active stabilization of public contracts.
- `1.0.0`: first stable public API after the core contracts, package exports, and security model are
  considered settled.
- Before `1.0.0`, public API simplifications should still ship as explicit minor releases with a
  changelog entry.
