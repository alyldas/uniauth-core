# Local Auth Flows

UniAuth keeps local auth flows headless. Applications own routes, forms, cookies, delivery
providers, queues, password policy, and rate-limit storage.

## OTP

Use the unified OTP API for email and phone sign-in:

```ts
const challenge = await service.public.otp.start({
  purpose: VerificationPurpose.SignIn,
  channel: OtpChannel.Email,
  target: 'alice@example.com',
})

const result = await service.public.otp.signIn({
  verificationId: challenge.verificationId,
  secret: 'code from user input',
  channel: OtpChannel.Email,
})

const resent = await service.public.otp.resend({
  verificationId: challenge.verificationId,
})

await service.admin.verifications.cancelOtp({
  verificationId: challenge.verificationId,
  channel: OtpChannel.Email,
})
```

`finishOtpChallenge` remains for non-sign-in verification purposes such as link, re-auth, recovery,
and app-owned custom purposes.

If the route already trusts a local `sessionToken` and only needs a recent-auth OTP challenge for
the current account, prefer the current-account helper over rebuilding the owned-target lookup in
application code:

```ts
const challenge = await service.account.reAuth.startOtp({
  sessionToken,
  identityId,
  channel: OtpChannel.Email,
})

const resent = await service.account.reAuth.resendOtp({
  sessionToken,
  verificationId: challenge.verificationId,
})

const confirmation = await service.account.reAuth.finishOtp({
  sessionToken,
  verificationId: resent.verificationId,
  secret: 'code from user input',
})
```

The application still owns how the confirmation object is stored as a recent-auth marker in its own
session, cookie, or server-side request context.

If the user abandons that step instead of finishing it, the route can cancel the current-account
challenge on the same trusted boundary:

```ts
await service.account.reAuth.cancelOtp({
  sessionToken,
  verificationId: challenge.verificationId,
})
```

If the UI only needs to know whether a fresh recent-auth step is currently required for a sensitive
self-service action, prefer the dedicated status helper over hand-rolled freshness math:

```ts
const status = await service.account.reAuth.status({
  sessionToken,
  action: AuthPolicyAction.ChangePassword,
  reAuthenticatedAt: recentAuthMarker,
})
```

The default OTP generator emits a 6-digit numeric code. Applications can configure a numeric length
from 4 to 8 digits, provide a custom generator, or pass a per-request `secret`. Per-request secrets
win over configured generation. Empty generated secrets are rejected before a verification is
created.

`emailOtpSubject` customizes only the built-in email OTP subject. Full templates, localization,
provider payloads, queues, retry, and dead-letter behavior remain sender-adapter concerns. See
[OTP delivery boundary](otp-delivery.md).

## Magic Link

Email magic links are sign-in verifications delivered through `EmailSender`. Core creates and hashes
the secret, then calls your `createLink` function.

```ts
const magic = await service.public.magicLink.start({
  email: 'alice@example.com',
  createLink: ({ verificationId, secret }) =>
    `/auth/magic?verification=${verificationId}&token=${secret}`,
})

await service.public.magicLink.finish({
  verificationId: magic.verificationId,
  secret: 'token from request',
})

const resentMagic = await service.public.magicLink.resend({
  verificationId: magic.verificationId,
  createLink: ({ verificationId, secret }) =>
    `/auth/magic?verification=${verificationId}&token=${secret}`,
})

await service.admin.verifications.cancelMagicLink({
  verificationId: magic.verificationId,
})
```

The application owns route parsing, redirects, cookies, and browser security headers.

## Passwords

Passwords use `CredentialRepo`, `PasswordHasher`, and an optional `PasswordPolicy` for new password
material. Core does not bundle a password hashing runtime or strength rules; production apps should
pass a hasher backed by their chosen algorithm, runtime, and parameters, plus a policy backed by
their strength and breached-password requirements.

```ts
await service.account.password.set({
  sessionToken,
  password: 'password from settings form',
  reAuthenticatedAt: recentAuthMarker,
})

await service.public.password.signIn({
  email: 'alice@example.com',
  password: 'password from sign-in form',
})
```

Production bootstraps can set `requirePasswordPolicy: true` to fail fast when password flows are
enabled without an application password policy.

The password sign-in method is also an `AuthIdentity` with provider `password`, so unlink policy and
last-sign-in-method protection stay shared with provider, OTP, and magic-link identities.

Use `changePassword` when the user knows the current password. Use email password recovery when the
user only has a recovery token:

```ts
const recovery = await service.public.passwordRecovery.start({
  email: 'alice@example.com',
  createLink: ({ verificationId, secret }) =>
    `/auth/recovery?verification=${verificationId}&token=${secret}`,
})

await service.admin.credentials.finishPasswordRecovery({
  verificationId: recovery.verificationId,
  secret: 'token from request',
  newPassword: 'new password from reset form',
})

const resentRecovery = await service.public.passwordRecovery.resend({
  verificationId: recovery.verificationId,
  createLink: ({ verificationId, secret }) =>
    `/auth/recovery?verification=${verificationId}&token=${secret}`,
})

await service.admin.verifications.cancelPasswordRecovery({
  verificationId: recovery.verificationId,
})
```

Recovery does not create a session. Applications can decide whether a successful reset should be
followed by a separate sign-in.

If the route already trusts a local session token and only needs to prove the current password
before a sensitive self-service mutation, prefer the current-account confirmation helper:

```ts
const confirmation = await service.account.reAuth.confirmPassword({
  sessionToken,
  currentPassword: body.currentPassword,
})
```

The confirmation is the recent-auth marker: it includes the trusted `currentSessionId`, `userId`,
`markerId`, and `reAuthenticatedAt`. Store and forward that object, not a client supplied timestamp.
Token-based current-account mutation helpers reject a bare `Date`, unknown marker ids, and markers
issued for another session.

If the route must actively enforce the same recent-auth policy before app-owned follow-up work,
keep that on the trusted token boundary too:

```ts
await service.account.reAuth.assert({
  sessionToken,
  action: AuthPolicyAction.ChangePassword,
  reAuthenticatedAt: recentAuthMarker,
})
```

Current-account linking routes can pass that same recent-auth marker into
`account.identities.link(...)` instead of resolving the current user separately. See
[Account security recipes](account-security.md) for the canonical route shape.

## Neutral Responses

Public start responses should not reveal whether an account exists. Core keeps start flows focused
on challenge creation/delivery and uses neutral errors for password credential misses, wrong
passwords, disabled users, and inconsistent credential state.

Applications should avoid exposing repository lookups, sender decisions, or rate-limit bucket names
directly in HTTP responses.

For trusted resend cooldown reads and canonical 429 shaping, use
[OTP and magic-link abuse-control recipes](abuse-control.md).

For trusted cancellation endpoints that terminate pending verification flows without direct
repository writes, use [OTP and magic-link abuse-control recipes](abuse-control.md).

## Rate Limits

Wire `RateLimiter` to security-sensitive attempts:

- `RateLimitAction.ProviderSignIn`: provider and provider user id.
- `RateLimitAction.OtpStart`: channel and normalized target.
- `RateLimitAction.OtpFinish`: channel and verification id.
- `RateLimitAction.MagicLinkStart`: email channel and normalized email.
- `RateLimitAction.MagicLinkFinish`: email channel and verification id.
- `RateLimitAction.MagicLinkResend`: email channel and normalized email.
- `RateLimitAction.PasswordSignIn`: email channel and normalized email.
- `RateLimitAction.PasswordRecoveryStart`: email channel and normalized email.
- `RateLimitAction.PasswordRecoveryFinish`: email channel and verification id.
- `RateLimitAction.PasswordRecoveryResend`: email channel and normalized email.
- `RateLimitAction.OtpResend`: channel and normalized target.

The core port is intentionally storage/backend agnostic. Redis, database counters, edge rate limits,
headers, retry-after formatting, and abuse analytics remain application or adapter concerns.
Production runtime construction requires a limiter by default; set `requireRateLimiter: false` only
for low-level tests or controlled internal runtimes. Verification resend cooldown defaults to 60
seconds in production runtime configuration and can be set to `0` explicitly when a test or
local-only flow needs immediate resend behavior.

Public helper surface:

- `rateLimitKey(...)` for canonical key composition when tests or surrounding middleware need the
  same low-level format as core;
- `getRateLimitedErrorDetails(error)` for typed inspection of stable `rate_limited` errors;
- `getVerificationResendWindow(...)` for trusted resend countdown and verification cooldown reads;
- `cancelVerification(...)` and the flow-aware cancellation helpers for trusted shutdown of pending
  verification flows.

## Production Boundaries

Current local auth hardening does not try to solve every production edge. The OTP delivery boundary
is documented in [OTP delivery boundary](otp-delivery.md), and production normalization policy can
be wired through the shared `normalizer` runtime option documented in
[Normalization boundary](normalization.md).

[Security model](security.md).
