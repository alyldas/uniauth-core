## Local Setup

Use Node.js 22 locally. The repository keeps `.node-version` as the runtime marker.

```sh
npm ci
npm run check
```

Use focused commands while developing:

```sh
npm run test
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
```

## Package Gate

Before opening or updating a pull request, run:

```sh
npm run check
```

This matches the CI class of checks for the package: format check, lint, typecheck, 100% coverage,
export smoke tests, package lint, package type-resolution checks, and `npm pack --dry-run`.

See [Development](docs/development.md) for the Docker gate and CI run model.

## Commit Messages

Commit messages are checked with Commitlint and the Conventional Commits format:

```text
feat: add provider registry
fix: prevent unsafe identity unlink
docs: update release checklist
```

Husky installs the local `commit-msg` hook from `npm run prepare` when the project is inside a git
repository. Outside git, the hook installer exits without changing anything.

## Release Flow

Use Conventional Commits and let Release Please prepare releases. Regular development commits should
not manually change release metadata.

Release Please owns these files in its release PR:

- `package.json`: package version.
- `package-lock.json`: lockfile package version.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: release section and compare links.

After changes land on `main`, Release Please opens or updates the release PR. Merge that release PR
to let the release workflow create the `v*` tag, GitHub release notes, and GitHub Packages publish.
Do not commit, amend, or force-push directly to `release-please--*` branches. If release metadata
needs correction, make the source correction on a normal branch, merge it into `main`, and let
Release Please refresh the release PR.

## Dependency Policy

Runtime-facing dependency updates must match the supported runtime contract. The package currently
supports Node.js 22 and newer, and CI verifies the minimum supported runtime in `node:22-alpine`.

Keep `@types/node` on the minimum supported Node.js major line. Do not merge major `@types/node`
updates until `engines.node`, Docker, CI, examples, and docs intentionally move to the same minimum
Node.js major.

Dependabot may update regular development tooling within its configured groups. Review major updates
as compatibility work, not routine maintenance.

## Changelog Policy

`CHANGELOG.md` is release metadata. Do not edit it in regular feature, fix, refactor, docs, or test
pull requests.

Release Please creates and updates changelog entries from the Conventional Commits that land on
`main`. Keep commit messages user-facing enough to become release notes without heavy editing.

Every changelog bullet must link to the commit that introduced the change. Release Please does this
automatically for conventional commits. If a release PR needs manual changelog cleanup, keep the
commit links and compare links intact.

Prefer concrete release notes over vague summaries. Good entries name the behavior, API, package
contract, or operational workflow that changed. Avoid entries that only say "cleanup", "refactor",
or "misc changes" unless that is genuinely the public release impact.

Manual changelog edits are allowed only in Release Please PRs or dedicated documentation cleanup
pull requests. When a large feature was already squash-merged, multiple clarified changelog bullets
may point to the same squash commit, but future large changes should preserve individual commits so
the generated changelog is naturally granular.

## Merge Policy

The repository is configured for a protected-branch workflow:

- `main` requires pull requests.
- The required status check is `check`.
- Branches must be up to date before merge.
- Conversations must be resolved before merge.
- Force pushes and branch deletion are blocked.
- Administrator enforcement is enabled.
- Direct commits, amend pushes, and force pushes to `release-please--*` branches are forbidden.

Use rebase merge for regular feature, API, security, and package-hygiene pull requests. Keep each
change as a small, Conventional Commit so Release Please can build useful changelog entries from the
commits that land on `main`.

Do not squash large feature, API, or package-hygiene pull requests if the release should have a
useful changelog. Squash merge turns the entire pull request into one commit, so Release Please can
only create one changelog entry.

Squash merge is acceptable for small single-purpose pull requests and for Release Please pull
requests such as `chore(main): release 0.5.0`.

Merge commits are disabled for this repository. Prefer a linear `main` history with rebase merges
for development PRs and squash merges for release PRs.

## Contributor Licensing

By contributing to this repository, you agree that your contribution may be distributed under the
public package license and under separate commercial licenses or private agreements offered by the
project maintainer.

## Design Rules

- Keep core headless and framework-agnostic.
- Add provider, storage, and HTTP integrations around core, not inside core.
- Do not add silent account merge behavior.
- Keep public errors stable and avoid leaking account ownership state.
- Add tests for security-sensitive behavior before changing policy or orchestration.

## Source Boundaries

`npm run lint` enforces source import boundaries.

- `src/domain`, `src/contracts`, and `src/ports` must stay implementation-free.
- `src/application` must not import provider adapters, bridges, persistence adapters, or testing
  modules.
- `src/providers` families must stay isolated from each other and from application, persistence,
  bridge, and testing internals.
- `src/postgres` stays below the application layer.
- `src/utils` stays reusable and must not drift upward into application or adapter ownership.

If a change needs a new dependency direction, document the reason in the same pull request instead
of bypassing the rule silently.
